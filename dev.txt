Why not just use Firebase?
A: Firebase is a good quick and easy way to implement this app. I decide to develop a real 
back-end just for learning purpose.

Stack in detail:
Front-end: React with create-react-app, Style Component, and axios for client-server communication.

the front-end will be implement first with hard coded data
for testing purpose.
The backend will be implement later with authentication first, then
database the the final product will be host with heroku.
